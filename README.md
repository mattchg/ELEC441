This is the foundation of the system model for a quadcopter.
It contains the a linearized state space model that relates voltage inputs to torque about the the quadcopters center of mass.
It utilizes permanent magnet DC motors, idealized propellers and a simplified electronics implementation.
The next steps would be to implement a controller.
